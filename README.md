* GitHub is very easy to use/learn and makes it easy to collaborate on the same thing with everyone without making duplicate copies. Please contact Abdullah for more info on how to use it.
* Please read the code style guide. If making functions/classes/fields, **PLEASE** conform to the given specifications or else the code will be harder to read.
